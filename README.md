# HAVE FUN WITH ALL C STANDARD HEADERS

This is a project i'm doing to deep dive in the C world.

The one file in this repo imports almost every header there is and defines a function to test the functionalities of each one of them. What you do with this file is up to you, but I would recommend you to:

1. *read* the functions (I've put a lot of comments in them explaining everything)
2. *run the program* calling the ones you want to see in action
3. *modify* them to try to __break things__

Anyways, good luck and have a great life.
